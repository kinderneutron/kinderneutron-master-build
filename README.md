Welcome to the KinderNeutron Capstone API repository! This API serves as the backend logic for the KinderNeutron project, a culmination of our academic efforts for our FYP
## Overview

The KinderNeutron project aims to revolutionize home automation and security by integrating deep learning, IoT devices, and web/mobile applications. The API acts as the bridge between the user-facing applications (web/mobile) and the IoT devices, enabling functionalities such as person detection, light control, and activity logging.

## Features

- Person detection using cv techniques.
- Control IoT devices (e.g., lights, cameras) based on detection events.
- Log activities and events for monitoring and analysis.
- Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
